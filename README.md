🍴 Restaurant Rating & Consumer Preference Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project explores consumer dining habits and restaurant performance across various cities in Mexico and the southwestern United States. By analyzing a dataset of 138 unique consumers and 101 distinct cuisines, I used Power BI to identify the correlation between price points, service offerings (like alcohol and parking), and overall customer ratings.

📊 Key Insights
Top Performers: "Tortas Locas Hipocampo" emerged as the highest-rated establishment with a total rating score of 48, followed closely by "Puesto De Tacos."

Cuisine Popularity: Mexican cuisine is the overwhelming favorite among consumers, followed by Bar and Cafeteria styles, indicating a strong market preference for local and casual dining.

Consumer Demographics: The vast majority of consumers in this dataset are Students (113) and Single (124), suggesting that affordable, student-friendly dining options have the highest engagement.

Price Point Dynamics: Mid-range pricing is the most common strategy, accounting for 46.15% of the analyzed restaurants, while high-priced venues represent the smallest market share (19.23%).

Service Correlation: Analysis of top-performing restaurants shows a mix of service levels, but those with Public Parking and Wine & Beer options tend to maintain higher consistent overall ratings.

🛠️ Technical Toolkit
Behavioral Analytics: Engineered a dashboard in Power BI that segments data by consumer occupation and marital status to uncover targeted marketing insights.

Geospatial Visualization: Integrated Bubble Maps to visualize restaurant density across key regions, including Mexico City and San Luis Potosí.

Advanced Data Visuals:

Funnel Charts: To rank top restaurants by cumulative rating.

Gauge Charts: For tracking the average global rating against target benchmarks.

Tree Maps: To visualize preferred cuisines by total consumer count.

Data Cleansing: Standardized varied rating scales and categorized 100+ unique cuisines for streamlined reporting.
